Info about me
-
I'm 15 years old and I'm interested in Computer Security and Coding/Programming. 
I'm currently learning Python but have been looking into other programming languages along the way. 
I have started to enjoy a little bit of hacking for some reason something is very satisfying about how machines work and what makes them do something that they are
not supposed to or get exploited by a complicated script or a few simple lines of code.
