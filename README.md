Im 15 years old and im intrested in Computer Secuirty and Coding/Programming.
Im curently learning Python but have been looking into other programing languages along the way.
I have started enjoyed a little bit of hacking for some reason something is very satisfying about how machines work and what makes them do something that they are not supposed to or get expolited by a complicated script or simple lines of code.
